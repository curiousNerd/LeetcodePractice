Some Important pointers:

1.  The Big O complexity order is :
    ->  O(1) < O(log n) < O(n) < O(n log n) < O(n^2) < O(2^n) < O(n!)

2. Whenever we declare an array using new operator the elements are automatically initialized
    -> 0 (for numeric types)
    -> false (for boolean)
    -> null (for reference types)

    Declaring array is a two step process
    -> int intArray[];    //declaring array
    -> intArray = new int[20];  // allocating memory to array

    -> int[] intArray = new int[20]; // combining both statements in one


3. Memoization: It is an optimization technique used primarily to speed up computer programs
                by storing the results of expensive function calls and returning the cached result
                when the same inputs occur again.

4. Arrays.sort() is based on TimSort algorithm and has a time complexity of O(n log n)
